11:29:29 AM. Spent 20 minutes on this logging script. I found in the summer that having something like this can really help, but this time my script is a little fancier! I'll probably just post the raw logs on zack.li the morning after, so I can review the previous day and keep track at the same time.
11:30:08 AM. Current task: Set up development environment for my website zack.li on this work computer.
11:51:58 AM. Added a nice color scheme to my gnome terminal.
12:06:04 PM. Trying to find a replacement Jekkyl theme. My current one is too bloated.
12:13:16 PM. Headed out to eat some ice cream with the other grad students, probably will get back to work around two or three in the afternoon.
01:44:04 PM. Back from ice cream, I'm relearning how to use git.
01:53:29 PM. Successfully added my ssh key to github, pushed new theme to website.
03:54:27 PM. Website now up and running! Writing a nice way to process and display my logs.
