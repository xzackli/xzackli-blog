I use some Python cell magic repeatedly -- this post is so I can refer to it
when I need to paste it into a new notebook.

```
%matplotlib inline
%load_ext autoreload
%autoreload 2
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'
```

```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

The `autoreload` lets me edit any imported code files and have them change in real time, which is really nice for the notebook workflow.
