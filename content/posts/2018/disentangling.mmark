*This post is a summary of [arXiv:1806.10165](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10165) for general audiences.*

Something makes the edges of galaxies [spin faster than they should](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve), speeds up the galaxies in [clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coma_Cluster), bends the light going through [colliding clusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Cluster) in a way that is offset from the stars, produced a [ripple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_acoustic_oscillations) in the large-scale density of galaxies, and seeded the formation of [structure observed in the CMB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda-CDM_model).

One stone that can slay all five of these birds is the assumption of an unseen form of matter which does not interact with ordinary matter (like photons and atoms) in any way except gravitationally. We call this *dark matter*. It must be "cold", because dark matter with too much kinetic energy would not settle down quickly enough to reproduce the number of galaxies we see today. All other properties of dark matter remain a mystery, in particular the connection between dark matter and the standard model.

There do exist standard model particles which have a very low probability of interacting with other particles, like neutrinos. To detect neutrinos, we have to make giant detectors out of pure materials like [Antarctic ice.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IceCube_Neutrino_Observatory). Similar efforts to
