I've written an [introduction to Fisher information matrices](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/xzackli/fishchips-public/blob/master/notebooks/Introduction%20to%20Fisher%20Forecasting.ipynb) for cosmology, a Jupyter notebook which should teach some of the theory behind Fisher matrices while also providing a hands-on guide. After an advanced undergraduate or early graduate student has completed the notebook, they'll have written a basic Fisher code for themselves.

The ideas for this came about after developing the code [fishchips](https://github.com/xzackli/fishchips-public). Making Fisher matrices is pretty easy, but reading papers is a slow way to learn about specific scientific tools, and it's not easy to build intuition either.
