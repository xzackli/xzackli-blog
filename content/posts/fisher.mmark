description: an educational Jupyter notebook for cosmological forecasts

I've written an [introduction to cosmological forecasting with Fisher information matrices](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/xzackli/fishchips-public/blob/master/notebooks/Introduction%20to%20Fisher%20Forecasting.ipynb), a Jupyter notebook which should teach some of the theory behind Fisher matrices while also providing a hands-on guide. After an advanced undergraduate or early graduate student has completed the notebook, they'll have written a basic Fisher code for themselves!

The ideas for this came about after developing the code [fishchips](https://github.com/xzackli/fishchips-public). Making Fisher matrices is pretty easy, but I felt like reading papers is a hard way to learn about specific scientific tools, and it's especially bad for building intuition.
