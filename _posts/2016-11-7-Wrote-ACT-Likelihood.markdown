I wrote up a Python implementation of the ACTPol season 2 Fortran likelihood. I've written up quite a bit of documentation for this, and it's available publically on [Github](https://github.com/xzackli/actpols2_like_py).

##$ This Week, In Lists!

#### Learning
* Finish relearning GR.
* [ ] Memorize the equations for the stars class.

#### Research
* ACTPol season 2 likelihood testing -- check if our parameters match those of E. Calabrese. 
* Apply the new likelihood for isocurvature
* Test out the affine-invariant ensemble sampler.
