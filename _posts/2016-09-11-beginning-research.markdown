This semester I'm working with [Jo Dunkley][jo] on a project using ACTPol data and the numerical code [CLASS][classcode]. On Friday I compiled the CLASS code (surprisingly pleasant) and ran the example configuration. Using the code's plotting script `CPU.py`, one obtains the figure below.

The basic use of CLASS seems to be the generation of CMB structure (nicely shown via power spectrum) given some input cosmological parameters. Since the software is now compiled and working, my next step will be to determine how to vary the adiabatic perturbation input parameter.
