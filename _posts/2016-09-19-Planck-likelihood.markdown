I didn't spend very much time on research since Wednesday, instead focusing on some problem sets for classes. Last Friday, I downloaded and set up the Planck 2015 likelihood for testing purposes, and ran a test configuration. The Planck likelihood has a billion nuisance parameters! 

Here's a small section of the triangle plot, involving a few nuisance parameters and a few cosmological parameters.
